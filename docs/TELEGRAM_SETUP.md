# Telegram setup

Five minutes, once. You need two things: a bot token and the numeric id of a
private channel the bot can post into.

Nothing here is exposed to visitors. The token lives in an environment variable
on the server and is never sent to a browser.

> **Not ready to make a bot yet?** `npm run preview` runs the entire site
> against a stand-in storage service on your own machine — browse, play,
> download, upload, everything — with no bot and no Telegram account. See the
> README. Come back here when you are ready to store files for real.

---

## 1. Create the bot

1. Open Telegram and message [**@BotFather**](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Send `/newbot`.
3. Give it a display name (anything, e.g. "MontSong Storage").
4. Give it a username ending in `bot` (e.g. `montsong_storage_bot`).

BotFather replies with a token that looks like:

```
7123456789:AAH8k2LmQwErTyUiOpAsDfGhJkLzXcVbNm0
```

Put it in `.env`:

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="7123456789:AAH8k2LmQwErTyUiOpAsDfGhJkLzXcVbNm0"
```

> **Treat this like a password.** Anyone holding it can read and delete
> everything in the storage channel. Never commit it, never paste it into a
> chat or an issue. If it leaks, send `/revoke` to BotFather and generate a new
> one, then update the environment variable and restart.

---

## 2. Create the storage channel

A **private channel** is the right home for these files.

1. In Telegram: **New Channel**.
2. Name it something you will recognise — "MontSong Storage".
3. Set it to **Private**.
4. **Administrators → Add Admin →** search for your bot's username and add it.
   Leave "Post Messages" enabled; it needs that. Enabling "Delete Messages" as
   well lets the site clean up storage when you delete a track — recommended,
   though not required.

**Why a channel rather than a private chat with the bot?** A channel's history
belongs to the channel, so clearing your own chats cannot take the library with
it, and you can add a second admin without handing over your account.

---

## 3. Find the channel's numeric id

Channel ids are negative and start with `-100`. Two ways to get it:

**The easy way.** Forward any message from the channel to
[**@userinfobot**](https://t.me/userinfobot) or
[**@getidsbot**](https://t.me/getidsbot). It replies with the id.

**Without a third-party bot.** Post any message in the channel, then open this
URL in a browser, substituting your token:

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates
```

Look for `"chat":{"id":-1001234567890,...}`. That number is the id.

> If `getUpdates` comes back empty, post a fresh message in the channel and
> reload — it only returns recent updates, and only if no webhook is set.

Put it in `.env`:

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_STORAGE_CHAT_ID="-1001234567890"
```

---

## 4. Verify

```bash
npm run setup
```

Paste in the token and the channel id when it asks, and it runs every check
below and reports on each one. You can also do it from the running site: sign
in and go to **Admin → Storage → Test connection**.

A pass tells you three things at once: the token is valid, the channel exists,
and the bot can see it. A failure names which of the three went wrong.

| What it says | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| "The media storage credentials were rejected" | The token is wrong or was revoked. Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, or get a new one from BotFather. |
| "The configured storage chat could not be found" | The id is wrong, or the bot was never added to the channel. Re-check step 3, and confirm the bot is an administrator. |
| "The bot does not have permission to post" | Add it as an administrator with "Post Messages" enabled. |
| "The storage chat is a private chat" (warning) | It works, but a private channel is safer — see step 2. |
| "A network proxy or firewall refused to pass the request" | Nothing is wrong with your token or channel — the request never left the machine. The host running MontSong must be allowed to make outbound HTTPS requests to `api.telegram.org`. Common on locked-down company networks, some university Wi-Fi, and sandboxed CI runners. |
| "something on the network answered in its place" | Same class of problem: a captive portal, ISP landing page or transparent proxy replied instead of Telegram. Check the connection, DNS, and any proxy settings. |

## The API limits that shape this

Verified against Telegram's Bot API documentation, September 2026.

### Cloud Bot API — `api.telegram.org`

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upload (`sendAudio`, `sendDocument`) | up to **50 MB** |
| Download (`getFile`) | up to **20 MB** |
| `getFile` link lifetime | guaranteed **at least one hour** |
| Rate limit | roughly **30 messages/second**; a `429` carries `retry_after` |

**The asymmetry is the whole story.** A bot may send a 50 MB file and then be
unable to fetch it back. This site has to fetch every file back — that is what
a download *is* — so the binding limit is 20 MB, not 50.

`MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_BYTES` is therefore clamped to 20 MB on the cloud API. Raising
it in `.env` does not raise the ceiling; the application clamps it at startup
and says so on the Storage screen. Accepting a 30 MB upload would mean storing a
track that can never be played.

**In practice:** a 5-minute MP3 at 320 kbps is ~12 MB; at 192 kbps, ~7 MB. A
30-second ringtone is 1–2 MB. Most libraries never touch the limit.

### Local Bot API server

Telegram publishes the Bot API server itself: [tdlib/telegram-bot-api][repo].
Running it with `--local` changes the limits:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Upload | up to **2000 MB** |
| Download | **no size limit** |
| `getFile` | returns an absolute path on that machine, no HTTP fetch needed |

This is Telegram's own software, used as documented — not a workaround.

[repo]: https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api

**To use it:**

1. Get `api_id` and `api_hash` from <https://my.telegram.org/apps>.
2. Run the server (Docker is the easiest route):

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name telegram-bot-api \
     -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8081 \
     -v telegram-bot-api-data:/var/lib/telegram-bot-api \
     -e TELEGRAM_API_ID=<your api_id> \
     -e TELEGRAM_API_HASH=<your api_hash> \
     -e TELEGRAM_LOCAL=1 \
     aiogram/telegram-bot-api:latest
   ```

3. Point MontSong at it:

   ```dotenv
   TELEGRAM_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8081"
   TELEGRAM_API_LOCAL_MODE="true"
   MAX_AUDIO_UPLOAD_BYTES="524288000"   # 500 MB, or whatever you want
   ```

   `TELEGRAM_API_LOCAL_MODE=true` tells MontSong that `getFile` will return a
   filesystem path rather than a downloadable URL. **Only set it when the
   server actually runs with `--local` and shares a filesystem with MontSong**
   — if the two are in separate containers, either share a volume or leave this
   `false` so files are fetched over HTTP instead.

4. Restart and re-run the connection test. The Storage screen will report
   "Local Bot API server" and the new ceiling.

### What is deliberately not used

**MTProto** (the client API, via GramJS, Telethon and similar) would raise the
limits further, and bots can authenticate with it. It is not used here because
it is a substantially heavier client with a different auth model and session
state to manage, for a gain the local Bot API server already provides through a
supported, documented path.

No unofficial endpoints, no scraping, and no third-party file-hosting proxies
are used anywhere in this project.

---

## Rate limits and how they are handled

Telegram does not publish exact numbers. The well-established practical ceiling
is around 30 messages/second, and any call may answer `429` with a
`parameters.retry_after` telling you how long to wait.

The documented correct behaviour is to wait exactly that long and retry.
Ignoring it escalates the cooldown. `src/lib/telegram/client.ts` honours
`retry_after` on every call, retries `5xx` and transport failures with
exponential backoff, and never retries a deterministic `4xx`.

Two design choices keep the site far below any limit:

- **A resolved file location is cached for 45 minutes.** Telegram guarantees
  the `getFile` path for at least an hour; refreshing at 45 minutes means a busy
  track costs one `getFile` per 45 minutes rather than one per request.
- **Files are cached on disk.** After the first play, every subsequent play and
  every seek is served locally. A track that gets shared widely costs one
  Telegram transfer, not thousands.

---

## Where the files actually are

Each upload becomes one message in your private channel. You can open the
channel and see them; that is normal, and it is a useful backup view.

**Do not delete those messages by hand.** The site keeps a record pointing at
each one. Delete a track from **Admin → Songs** instead, and the message goes
with it. If a message does get deleted directly, playback for that track will
fail with a clear error, and you can delete or re-upload it from the admin.
